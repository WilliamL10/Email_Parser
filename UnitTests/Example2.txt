Subject: Reaching 300M ARR!

Hi Armin,

Being the president of global sales and looking to grow the ARR to $300M by 2025 and growing the team to support this is an admirable goal.

In light of this, would you be open to exploring options to accelerate?

Specifically, in the form of supporting all your new sales and marketing hires with enablements such as intent-data and qualified leads.

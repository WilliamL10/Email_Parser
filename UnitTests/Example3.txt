Good morning, Hannah!

First off, huge congratulations on the new role! I hope you managed to celebrate the promotion suitably in spite of lockdown?

Now, I'm not going to chew your ear off about how rugby is the best thing since sliced bread. I'm going to tell you that 9 of my 10 all-time favourite moments have been inside Twickenham stadium. And I'm 100% definitely not going to tell you that this year I bought my dad a signed 2003 World Cup winning shirt for his birthday.

And I won't tell you that it went down really, really well.

But I would love to talk about how your employees are at the moment at XYZ Rugby and where, if anywhere, we might be able to help keep them motivated, recognised, connected, and happy.

Can you spot a quick chat-sized gap in your calendar this week?

Subject: CX: Improving CSAT

Hi Josh,

Reaching out because I know XYZ is seeing unprecendented demand.

Has the team considered a chatbot to field questions?

I ask because we've helped e-commerce companies like XYZ with a similar challenge resulting in:

	1. Increasing agent productivity by 15%
	2. Reducing wait-times by 95%
	3. Increases in CSAT up to 30%

Would you be interested in receiving a case study related to this challenge? Happy to share more and answer any questions.
